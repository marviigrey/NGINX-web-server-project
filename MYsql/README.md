To have a web server we also need a database server,we can either create a new instance and install mySQL on it or we can just go ahead to install it on the nginx server. In this case we will carry out the installation on the nginx server to manage cost,but in real life scenerios its safer to install the database software on a different server.
Setup the mysql server and carry out all necessary configuration.
